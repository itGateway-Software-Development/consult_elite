                Vision Statement
            </h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300 text-justify">
              At Consult Elite, our vision is to empower the next generation of
              leaders by providing comprehensive support in education, business, and
              global trade. We aim to help Myanmar's youth unlock their full
              potential by guiding them towards world-class educational
              opportunities, enabling them to excel on the international stage. In
              addition to our commitment to education, we are dedicated to
              supporting local businesses by facilitating their expansion into
              international markets. Through innovation and strategic guidance, we
              aim to connect Myanmar's unique products with global opportunities,
              making them accessible in international markets.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-300 text-justify">
                Furthermore, we aspire to build a B2B e-commerce platform that enables the seamless global trade of Myanmar's resources, breaking down barriers for local businesses to thrive internationally. Through this platform, we will assist companies with consultation services, ensuring smooth and efficient transactions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-slate-300 text-justify">
                Our overarching goal is to create a holistic ecosystem that supports education, business development, and international trade, all under the Consult Elite umbrella, helping Myanmar's future succeed globally.
